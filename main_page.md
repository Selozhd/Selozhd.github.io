# Ahmet Balcioglu

Briefly about myself. I am a statistics master’s student with a passion for Mathematical Statistics and Machine Learning; more specifically, I am interested in probability theory, learning theory, high dimensional statistics, and the ways in which they can be applied to machine learning algorithms. I have received Hon. BS from the University of Toronto in Nov 2018, where I majored in physics and minored in mathematics and statistics. I have started my master’s in the fall of 2019. I have been working as an assistant researcher in Bogazici Univeristy department of Mathematics and as an AI researcher in the industry.

## Research

### Outliers, order statistics, and concentration inequalities
-  Main goal of our project is to have a distribution invariant robust estimator for anomalies based on order statistics.
- Responsible for developing a python library for heavy tail-data and for anomalous data generation and simulations.

### Optimal Control in Epidemiological Systems
-  Developing a variant of the SIR models that accounts for vaccination, waning immunity in order to do formulate an optimal control problem for best vaccination policies.
- Computationally simulated differential equations for the SIR type models and produced the plots for the following book chapter for which I was mentioned in acknowledgements:
	Optimal choice of vaccination scheduling in a population composed of two groups, to appear in Omeraki, Ş., Ingün Karkış, O. & Gonültaş, S. (Eds.). (2022). Interdisciplinary Perspectives on the Threat and Impact of Pandemics

#### Distilling transformer models for a low data setting
-  Application of using transfer learning transformer models for data stringent problems that require repetitive training.
- Using word-piece tokenization to help differentiate between word roots and suffixes agglutinative languages such as Turkish.
Research for an embedding guided RNN — March 2020– Present
-  Main goal of the project is to effectively incorporate  predetermined memory state based into a recurrent neural network, which can selectively memorise past states in the sequence.
- We expected that with the selection of a good. memory state we may in affect reduce the need for training time and data.

## Work
### Software Specialist,  ETIYA Information Technologies
-  Involved in the research and development of deep learning  and machine learning algorithms for natural language processing and anomaly detection.
- Proposed, led, and prepared biweekly reports for two research projects.
- Worked closely with the product team to build an adaptive slot filling model for natural language understanding.
-  Worked in collaboration with the backend team for the development and maintenance of a deep anomaly detection service.
